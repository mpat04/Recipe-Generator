# Recipe Generator
This is a GUI-based recipe generator.

## The Problem
My roommates and I are constantly having to throw out ingredients that go bad because we don't what we could make with them. This was very wasteful and expensive in the long run.

## How to Use
1) Select the cuisine(s) you want.
2) Select your dietary restrictions.
3) Enter the ingredients you want to use.
4) Click the generate button. 

## Tools
OpenAI's API was used for this program. It is powered by ChatGPT and uses the Chat Completion feature. To create the GUI I used customtkinter and the documentation for it can be found at https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/documentation/

## To Use This on Your Computer
1) Go to https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview and login
2) Go to the "API keys" tab
3) Press the "Create new secret key" and "Create secret key"
4) Go to https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python and follow the necessary steps

Finally run the program!
